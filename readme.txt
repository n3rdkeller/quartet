     Instructions

Welcome to our Quartet!

When you start the game, you are asked for the count
of players you want to play with. You can enter any
number from 2 to 8.

After entering a number, you are asked for your own name.
When you pressed enter after this, you can enter the names
for the next players. You can also choose to play against
ai if you want to. Therefore, just press "c" when you're
asked for a player's name, and all opponents from now on
are going to be computer opponents.

When the game starts, you can see the current players name,
the turn count, and the quartets this player has already
dropped.

Under this information you can see your opponents and their
indices. Theses numbers are important later when you
have to choose an opponent to ask for a card.

In the next lines you can see your own cards, your hand.

After this you get to see the question either for an opponent
(if there is more than 1 opponent) or for a card.

Choose your opponent if you have to and then type in the name
of a card you need to complete a quartet.
You can type e.g. 'SA' for the 'Spades Ace' or 'C8' for the
'Clubs 8'. Here again a small overview of the colors:  
♣︎ = C = clubs  | ♠︎ = S = spades
♥︎ = H = hearts | ♦︎ = D = diamonds

A quartet consists of 4 cards with different colors but the same
value.

If you asked an opponent for a card you needed and he had the card
it has automatically been added to your hand.
If you got a quartet with a card you just got you will be informed
and your quartet is dropped instantly.

The game is over if one player does not have any cards on his hand
left.

When the game is over you get to know who had most quartets and
so won the game.

Have fun!
